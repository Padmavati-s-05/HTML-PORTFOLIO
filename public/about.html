<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! I'm currently learning Full Stack Web Development, 
  and I've just started exploring the exciting world of Frontend Development.
  I'm diving into the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
  learning how to build simple, creative, and user-friendly web pages.
</p>

<p>As part of my early learning journey, 
  I've created a few small projects that reflect my progress so far:
</p>
<h4>A Movie Ranking List featuring some of my favorite movies with short descriptions.</h4>
<h4>A basic Birthday Invitation Page using only HTML.</h4>
<h4>An interactive Expanding Cards mini project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</h4>

<p>I'm passionate about growing my skills step by step and excited to 
  explore more advanced frontend and backend technologies as I move forward in my full stack journey. 
  This portfolio is a snapshot of my beginning â€” and there's a lot more to come!</p>
